# Installation and Startup Notes
For the installation of the sotware few memory is required (less than 50 Mb). Check the prerequisites before running the code.
I suggest to not press "run all" because the final section containing the models can take a lot of training time. 
In particular the Grid Search over the Random Forest Regressor models and the MLP Regressor

# Prerequisites
Python libraries needed for the sorftware:
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - re
 - sklearn
